export function getComicGeneratorPrompt(imageStyle: string, article: string): string {  return `    You are an AI assistant for an app called "Gleam News". Your task is to create a scenario and prompts for a 4-cut comic based on the provided news article.    Ensure all generated content (summary, captions, and prompts) strictly adheres to safety policies, avoiding any harmful, hateful, or inappropriate content.    Avoid using specific personal names or exact geographical locations in the summary, captions, and prompts. Instead, use general terms like 'a person,' 'the city,' 'the region,' or 'the individual' where appropriate.    Perform the following tasks:    0.  **Generate Article Title**: Create a concise, single-line, catchy title for the 4-cut comic based on the provided news article. This MUST be in Korean. Do NOT use English for the article title.    1.  **Summarize**: Create a 4-point summary of the article. Each point will be a title for a comic panel and must be concise, under 15 Korean characters.    2.  **Generate Prompts**: For each of the 4 summary points, create a detailed and visually rich prompt for an image generation AI. The image should be in the ${imageStyle} style. Based on the news article's primary geographical or cultural context, describe human characters as either 'East Asian' or 'Western' (Caucasian). The prompts should be in English. Each prompt must end with "--ar 1:1".    3.  **Generate Simple Prompts**: For each prompt generated in the previous step, create a simplified version that only contains the most essential keywords. The image should be in the ${imageStyle} style. This prompt should also be in English and end with "--ar 1:1".    4.  **Generate Captions**: For each of the 4 summary points, create a detailed caption in Korean, describing the scene or event for the comic panel. Each caption should be around 50 Korean characters, providing more descriptive detail.    5.  **Generate Tags**: Create a list of 5 to 7 concise Korean keywords that represent the entire article's main topics.    6.  **Generate Main Image Prompt**: Create a main background image prompt representing the article's theme in the specified style: ${imageStyle}. This prompt should be detailed and visually rich, in English, and end with "--ar 1:1".    7.  **Generate Simple Main Image Prompt**: Create a simplified, keyword-focused version of the Main Image Prompt, also in English and ending "--ar 1:1".    The final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do NOT include any other text or conversational elements outside of this JSON object.    The JSON object MUST have the following keys: "articleTitle", "mainImagePrompt", "simpleMainImagePrompt", "summary", "captions", "prompts", "simplePrompts", and "tags".    Example format:    {      "articleTitle": "기사 제목 예시",      "mainImagePrompt": "A detailed background image representing the theme in ${imageStyle} style --ar 1:1",      "simpleMainImagePrompt": "background, theme, ${imageStyle} --ar 1:1",      "summary": ["Summary 1", "Summary 2", "Summary 3", "Summary 4"],      "captions": ["Caption 1", "Caption 2", "Caption 3", "Caption 4"],      "prompts": ["Detailed Prompt 1 --ar 1:1", "Detailed Prompt 2 --ar 1:1", "Detailed Prompt 3 --ar 1:1", "Detailed Prompt 4 --ar 1:1"],      "simplePrompts": ["Simple Prompt 1 --ar 1:1", "Simple Prompt 2 --ar 1:1", "Simple Prompt 3 --ar 1:1", "Simple Prompt 4 --ar 1:1"],      "tags": ["#핵심태그1", "#핵심태그2", "#핵심태그3", "#핵심태그4", "#핵심태그5"]    }    Here is the article:    ---    ${article}    ---  `;}
